# hugo-griesemer
This is a Hugo theme based on [Sam Griesemer's website](https://samgriesemer.com/). It doubles as both a portfolio and a personal knowledge repository and the design is just excellent. He uses a custom build system to deploy the site and I didn't understand how to use it, so here we are.

Heavy WIP.
